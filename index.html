			<p id ="FirstBodyText">	Computers are electronic devices made to store and process data (unprocessed facts), 
					into information (processed facts). The data is typically in binary form, according to instructions 
					given to it in a variable program. Computers primary processors are composed out of many parts that we  		
					cannot see on the exterior. Each part inside the computer has a specific task that it must do to execute 
					a certain action that may or may not be shown on the monitor. In summary, computers gets input 
					(the data sent to the CPU), then processes it and either outputs it (processed information available), 
					or stores it in a secondary storage. Nowadays, private computers are mostly all connected to a network 
					(via wire or wireless communication methods). Computers communicate travel through those networks to its 
					destination and it typically travels at a very fast rate, unless you have a bad network connection. There 
					are a variety of networks, and a vast amount of network-communication methods as well. Sending your friend 
					a email who lives in another country, playing an online multiplayer video game, or even browsing the internet 
					requires a network connection. Computers would not be as popular as they are now if not for the invention of 
					the internet (largest network connection which connects the whole world together).

		<p id = "DVDRomDesc"> The DVD-ROM drive is designed specifically to read a DVD-ROM disc. All modern 
			      computers are equipped with a DVD-ROM drive. A DVD-ROM is a type of removable 
			      storage and is an abbreviation for Digital Versatile Disc-Read Only Memory. It 
			      stores large software applications and has a larger capacity than a CD-ROM. A 
			      DVD-ROM stores about 4.38 GB of data whereas a CD-ROM stores approximately 650 MB of 
			      data. A DVD-ROM permanently stores data files that cannot be changed, erased, or 
			      manipulated in any way. This component can be used to distribute large software applications.

		<p id = "HardDriveDesc"> The Hard Drive. A hard, disk-shaped platter made of magnetic material storing computer 
											  data as files for long term uses. The capacity of the hard drive is 
											  determined by how many bytes it can hold. Hard drive problems can occur 
											  if it gets physically damaged, overheated, worn out, or caused by malware. 
											  Most of the time, the hardware will need to be replaced. It is important to 
											  backup your data regularly because your hard drive will eventually wear out.
											  It receives the data from the CPU in the motherboard and/or from other external
											  parts like a floppy disk. (Picture shown on the right)

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column" style="background-color:#BAE1FE;">
				<h2 class = "tabletitles"> Heat sink (Fan) </h2>
					<p> Heat sinks (Fans) are used to keep things cool. It is usually a type of fan or any other 
					cooling device to maintain a component, such as a processor from overheating. There are 
					2 types of heat sinks: passive and active. Active heat sinks helps manage the computer’s power 
					supply and is typically a fan. The computer we disassembled and congregated has a active heat sink. Passive 
					heat sinks do not have mechanical components, therefore it is very reliable. Passive heat sinks are 
					constructed out of aluminum-finned radiators and removes heat through convection. This helps the other 
					proccesors in the pc to function properly like the CPU.
					</p>
			</div>
		<div class="column" style="background-color:#FCFEBA;">
			<h2 class = "tabletitles"> Motherboard </h2>
				<p> A motherboard (also referred to as the logic board or mainboard) is a one of the most important parts of the computer. It holds all the main pieces of the computer together, 
				like the CPU (Central Processing Unit), memory and connectors for input and output devices. The motherboard also contains 
				many sockets and slots to connect to various components. The base of the motherboard is made with non-conductive items, 
				usually some sort of rigid plastic. After thin layers of copper or aluminum foil are printed on the sheet. These layers are 
				referred to as traces. Traces are very narrow and form the circuits between the various components.
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column" style="background-color:#FEB39C;">
			<h2 class = "tabletitles"> Power Supply </h2>
				<p> The power supply converts one type of electrical power to another and supplies power to at least one electrical load. 
				In this case, the power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current power (AC) to low voltage direct current power (DC) to 
				the internal parts of the computer. Some power supplies have a switch that is used manually to select the type of voltage needed or 
				while others auto-adjust to a suitable voltage. This powers (with volts. typically 5V) standby functions (on the computer) and certain 
				peripherals. The CPU, heat sink, and other internal components to run.

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column" style="background-color:#FEB39C;">
				<h2 class = "tabletitles">The CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
					<p> A small, square chip with many little metallic pins (microprocessor) attached to the motherboard. It is the brain of the 
					computer performing mathematical and logical operations to retrieve and carry out instructions from the computer’s memory. 
					Modern CPU's have a heat sink and small fan attached to keep them cool as they create a lot of heat. This is the main proccesor
					and it procceses the data and turns it into information which is then sent back to an output device (the monitor) or stored in a 
					storage area like the hard drive and is available to be accessed again.
					</p>
			</div>
		<div class="column" style="background-color:#FCFEBA;">
			<h2 class = "tabletitles">RAM (Random Access Memory)</h2>
				<p>A type of computer memory used for short-term data storage installed in the motherboard and is used in various occasions (ex. 
				Playing a video game, opening tabs on a browser, sending an email to someone). It is faster than the hard drive, but not permanent.
				This type of computer memory can be accessed randomly and is lost when you shutdown, or power off, your computer. This part of the 
				motherboard interacts with the rest of the computer by sending the output information back to the monitor, or to another storage place 
				within the computer, when called to do so.
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column" style="background-color:#BAE1FE;">
			<h2 class = "tabletitles">The Graphics card</h2>
				<p>A graphics card is a video card is a peripheral that produces multiple output images to an output device such as a monitor. At 
				the core of the graphics card is a GPU (graphics processing unit) which is the principal part that does the most important calculations. 
				This component sends/outputs the resulting visuals back to your monitor through the CPU (central processing unit). A better performing graphics 
				card would allow higher fps (frames per second) when you are playing video games or running a program that requires a lot of graphics.

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column" style="background-color:#FEB39C;">
				<h2 class = "tabletitles"> The Speaker </h2>
					<p class = "white"> A voice coil drives the speaker. The voice coil is a coil of wire next to a magnet. When the signal becomes stronger it creates a magnetic 
					field which pushes it away from the magnet. When the signal becomes weaker the magnetic field decreases and the coil slides toward the magnet. 
					The coil is attached to the speaker cone (A flexible cone of paper or cloth that moves in time with the coil), pushing the air every time it moves. 
					These tiny pushes of air create sound waves that you hear from your speaker. The more air that is pushed out the louder the sound waves are. (there
					was no speakers in our computer so I used an image from google).
					</p>
			</div>
		<div class="column" style="background-color:#FCFEBA;">
			<h2 class = "tabletitles"> Chassis Intrusion Connector </h2>
				<p class = "white" > Definition of chassis: the outer framework of a piece of audio, video, radio, or computer equipment.
					A chassis intrusion connector is found on the motherboard of the computer that assists a chassis security feature that reveals if a chassis 
					component is removed/replaced. An alarm would sound through the speaker or peripheral speaker if connected. In order for the chassis intrusion circuit 
					to function, its power supply must be powered by alternating current (AC).

		<div class="column" style="background-color:#BAE1FE;">
			<h2 class = "tabletitles"> The Front IO USB Panel </h2>
				<p class = "white"> This is a panel located near the front of the computer and is used to connect external devices to the computer. The USB ports take input from a 
				flash drive and processes it in the CPU. then it outputs the result to the monitor or another output device. This is a connecting wire inserted between
				certain components to send input/output. (our Front IO USB Panel was stuck to the computer so I used a google image as well).

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column" style="background-color:#FEB39C;">
				<h2 class = "tabletitles"> Expansion Slots </h2>
					<p class = "black"> These are built in ports in the motherboard that allow for expansion cards to be inserted to enhance the performance of the computer. 
					Examples of expansion cards include video cards, graphics cards, sound cards, and network cards. This port is similar to the the Front IO USB Panel except
					it is built from the interior of the computer and inside the motherboard. The number of these ports can vary depending on the computers capacity in the motherboard,
					or the novelty of the computer. 
					</p>
			</div>
		<div class="column" style="background-color:#FCFEBA;">
			<h2 class = "tabletitles"> The Sound Card </h2>
				<p class = "black"> This card is an expansion card used for producing sounds from the speakers or to headphones. This part is not necessarily needed in a computer 
				but it is, either in the expansion slot or in the motherboard. When this card runs and how it runs is determined by the pc. For example, a sound card comes in play
				when you watch a video. These cards are also used to project your voices - computer-based communications such as 
				teleconferencing and voice over IP.
				(Used google image since our pc didnt have a sound card).
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column" style="background-color:#BAE1FE;">
			<h2 class = "tabletitles"> The Network Interface Card (NIC) </h2>
				<p class = "black"> A network interface card is a circuit board or card that is located in a computer so that the device can connect to a network.  This is similar to
				the sound card, graphics card, and RAM, because this card can be inserted into the Expansion slots. This card is responsible for providing hardware interface between
				a computer and a network (wired or wireless). This enables the device to network with other devices and it is not neccesary that every computer must have 
				a NIC card.
